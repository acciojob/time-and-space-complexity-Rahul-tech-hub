	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

	
	<p>Time complexity is a type of computational complexity that describes the time required to execute an algorithm with an efficient time. The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of time it takes for each statement to complete. </p>
    <p><b>Space complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program such as O(n), including the space of input values for execution. Calculate the space occupied by variables in an algorithm/program to determine space complexity. </p>
